# choice-behaviour
code to analyse value-driven behaviour during risky choice, translating complex neuroeconomic questions into testable problems.

1. single attribute choice: analyse user decision-making behavior in simplified choice environments where a single attribute influences outcomes, identifying how prior experience shapes behavioral trends over time.
        
2. multi-attribute choice: investigate how users integrate multiple attributes during complex decision-making scenarios, uncovering patterns in attribute weighting and value perception through individual choice data to inform predictive models of consumer preferences.
